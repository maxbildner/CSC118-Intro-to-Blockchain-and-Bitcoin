    "#### Storing Wallets in an Account Regsitry\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin uses the **UTXO** model, which stands for unspent transaction output. It's discussed in [Chapter 6 of Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch06.asciidoc#transaction-outputs-and-inputs), but we haven't discussed it in class yet. We will, but for now I'll give the very quick summary, using Alice as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin doesn't store a central account registry, where everybody's accounts and their associated balances are stored. In theory you can Alice's account balance by starting at the first block and iterating through every transaction ever recorded where Alice's public key occurs. You sum up all of the Bitcoin Alice ever received, and you subtract all of the Bitcoin she ever spent. The total is her balance. In reality, Alice has a piece of software called a wallet that keeps track of her balance. In order for others to verify this, when she makes a transaction, she specifies the locations of her unspent funds. The verification process is then just making sure those funds are indeed unspent. We'll go into more detail about this when we discuss Bitcoin Scripts in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum doesn't use the **UTXO** model. It uses an account model. But we're not implementing anything like Ethereum here. What we're doing is implementing something sort of like a simple version of Bitcoin, but we're going to use the account model instead of the **UTXO** model. The reason for this is just to save you time coding and to keep this assignment from growing too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we'll do is define an `Account_Registry`. It simply keeps a dictionary of public keys. Note that I'm not keeping `public_key` (i.e. `ecdsa.keys.VerifyingKey`) objects, but the hexstring representations of them (i.e. `VerifyingKey.to_string().hex()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values are dictionaries containing a `name`, `balance` and `wallet`. The `name` is just a string specifying the name of the account holder. It's just for convinience. It's hard to tell who is who when just reading hexadecimal strings, so we'd like to query their name, like 'alice'. The `balance` is the amount of currency they currently have. The `wallet` is a `Wallet` object. Remember, the `Wallet` contains bot of the keys. Obviously this wouldn't work in a real blockchain, since we don't make private keys available. It's just for our convinience. We'll pretend no one  on the network actually has this data available to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to code anything here. I've provided the full class. Do look over the code though."

    "#### Defining Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "We're finally getting to the good stuff. Below define the `Transaction` class. We want hash values and timestamps for transactions, so `Transaction` extends `Hashable`. Outside of that, a transaction has a `sender`, a `recipient` and the `amount` being transacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sender` attribute is the public key of the account sending currency. We store the `ecdsa.keys.VerifyingKey` object. We **DO NOT** store the hexadecimal string representation of the public key here. If we did, we wouldn't have useful methods available to us, like `VerifyingKey.verify()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `recipient` attribute is the public key of the account receiving the currency. We again use the `ecdsa.keys.VerifyingKey` object, for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `amount` attribute is the amount of currency being sent by the `sender` to the `recipient`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the hash we use four attributes. First we call the `to_string()` methods (but not `to_string().hex()` method) on the `sender` and `recipient`. Then we convert the `amount` (which is an `int`) to a `string`. We also convert `timestamp` from an `int` to a `string`. We hash their concatenation: `sha256(sender_str + recipient_str + amount_str + timestamp_str`). **Make sure to do it in that order**. `Hashable.hash_obj()` takes care of encoding the strings as bytestrings when necessary, and stores the hash as `hash_val`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one last attribute to mention, `signature`. If the transaction is going to be included in the blockchain, it had better be digitally signed by the `sender`, otherwise how would we be able to verify that the `sender` actually approved the transaction? The `signature` attribute is the digital signature produced by `Wallet.sign_message()`. If you recall, it's a bunch of bytes. We could convert to a hexstring and store that, but there is no reason to; we'll store the raw bytes. The caveat is that we can't include the `signature` as a parameter to the initialization function. The `signature` is the digital signature produced by the `sender` signing the `hash_val`. That means we first have to instantiate the transaction object and hash it. Then we can pass `hash_val` to the wallet of the `sender` calling `sign_message`. The resulting `signature` can then be stored in the `Transaction` object.\n",

    "#### Defining Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Block` class is a bit more complex than a `Transaction`, but not much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, `Block` extends `Hashable` so it has a hash stored in `hash_val` and a `timestamp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that to add a block to the blockchain it must refer to the hash of a previous block. We have a `prev_hash` attribute for that. Easy enough, when creating a `Block` pass in the `hash_val` of the most recently mined block. But what if it's the first block to be mined and added to the blockchain? In that case we'll use the value:\n",
    "\n",
    "`'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'` (a string with $64$ $0$ values).\n",
    "\n",
    "$64$ makes sense, but why a string of all $0$'s? Well it sort of arbitrary. But we know that to mine a block we have to beat a target difficulty, defined by the number of $0$'s it has. What's more difficult than all $0$'s?\n",
    "\n",
    "For defining the `Block` class we don't have to worry about specific values of `prev_hash`, that will come a bit later down, but its good to introduce it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we know a block should contain transactions. We'll create three different attributes related to transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is `coinbase`. Recall that the `coinbase` is the reward to the miner. For us, we'll define a `coinbase` transaction as a regular `Transaction` object. The only thing special about it is that we create a special attribute to identify it. There is only one `coinbase`, and its seperated out from the rest of the transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next attribute is `transactions`. This is a list (array) of transactions to be included in the block. Just to emphasize, the `coinbase` is **not** in this list, it's stored separately. Why a list? Shouldn't we be using a merkle tree? Well, yes that's what Bitcoin does. But again I want to reduce the work for you and keep the complexity low to keep the assignment from growing too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third transation-related attribute is the `transactions_hash`. Every `Transaction` object has the `hash_val` set. The `transactions` list is an array of `Transaction` objects, each with their own `hash_val`. To calculate the `transactions_hash` we **first** get the `hash_val` of the `coinbase`, **and then** iterate through the list, get the `hash_val` of each `Transaction` object, and concatenate them all together. Then we hash the concatenated string with `sha256()`. Remember, `hash_val` is stored as a hexadecimal string, so we need to byte encode the `hash_val` strings using `.encode()`. We call `hexdigest()` and store the result as `transactions_hash`. **It's important that you include the coinbase hash_val in the concatenation, and that it is first!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next are the `target` and `nonce` attributes. `target` is the difficulty setting for mining. Recall that when we mine a block, we calculate different hashes by iterating the `nonce` until the requisite number of $0$'s prefixing the `Block.hash_val` is reached. The `nonce` is a simple `int`, initialized to `0`. The `target` is a hexadecimal string of length $64$. But what does that have to do with the number of $0$'s? Well take this sample target:"

    "We won't define any blocks quite yet. We'll do that futher down.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining the Blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now let's define the `Blockchain` class. It's a bit bigger than the previous ones, but you can handle it. A `Blockchain` instance stores the state of the blockchain. It also is responsible for verifying information. Any blocks or transactions added must be validated by methods defined in `Blockchain`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Blockhain` stores the chain of blocks (suprise). The `chain` attribute is a simple list (array), that contains instances of `Block`. A `Block` object is appended to `chain` only after it has been verified. We'll discuss that in just a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Blockchain` also contains a transaction pool. In any given Blockchain, peers submit transactions to be included in blocks. But they don't send the transactions to miners over email, or through direct message. They place their transaction in the transaction pool. Miners will then build a block by taking some transactions out of the transaction pool, putting them in the block, and then mining the block. In reality miners choose transactions based on the miner fees those tranasations pay. The higher the amount a sender is willing to give to the miner, the more likely their transaction will be picked up first. We're not implementing fees, so we'll ignore that. The `transaction_pool` attribute is a list (array) of `Transaction` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember our `Account_Registry`? We bind it to our `Blockchain` instance in the `account_registry` attribute. We can either pass in an instance of `Account_Registry` or if not provided, instantiate a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Blockchain` instance is also instantiated with a `target` attribute. Didn't the `Block` class also have this? Yes, but we want one here to. The `Block.target` attribute is used during the mining process. The `Blockchain.target` attribute is used for verification. It says that all `Block` objects included in the `Blockchain` instance must have their targets below `Blockchain.target`. The initialization function doesn't take in a hex string for the target. Instead it uses a `num_zero_difficulty` argument, which is an `int`. This is the number of zeros that should prefix a block's `hash_val`. In other words the `target` is defined by the number of zeros set by `num_zero_difficulty`. The `target` is set to `num_zero_difficult` $0$'s, followd by however many $\\text{f}$'s it takes to reach a hexadecimal string of length $64$. I demonstrated that above, so hopefully it's fairly straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally there is the `mining_reward` attribute. All `Block.coinbase` transactions must have the `coinbase.amount` set to be less than or equal to `mining_reward`. If a block's `coinbase` transaction has an `amount` greater than `mining_reward`, then the block can't be included in the `chain`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That covers the attributes and the initialization function. Let's discuss some of the methods of `Blockchain`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`get_target()` is easy, it retrieves the set `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`get_last_hash()` returns the hash value of the most recently added block. What if no blocks have been added yet? We discussed that above. It should return a string of lenght $64$, with all $0$'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "`verify_transaction()` is our first verification method. How do we verify a transaction? A transaction is valid if it is signed (`Transaction.signature` is set), and the `sender` can validate the signature. Remember `sender` is a public key of type `ecdsa.keys.VerifyingKey`. We already have the verifying key right there. We also have the `Transaction` object, which contains both the `signature` attribute and the `hash_val` attribute which was the original message. All we need to do is call `verify` passing in the relevent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "`add_transaction()` adds a tranasction to the `transaction_pool`. It must first verify the transaction (hint: we just described that above). If it's valid, append it to the `transaction_pool`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`add_transactions()` is very similar. It takes in a list (array) of `Transaction` objects, validates all of them, and add each of them to the transaction pool. It should be dead simple, since we already defined the main components above.\n",
    "\n",
    "`get_n_transactions()` takes in `num` as an argument, and returns `num` transactions from the `transaction_pool`. It's important to emphasize here, that the transactions are **removed** from the transaction pool. Don't just reference them, take them out so they are no longer in the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "`verify_block()` is our second main verification method. How do we know a block is valid? Well first off, a `Block` object has a `coinbase` attribute contianing a transaction. The `amount` specified in that transaction should be less than or equal to `mining_reward`. In other words check that the miner has not rewarded themselves too much. Next we have to check the `hash_val` of the `Block` instance. This is where the `mine` argument for `Block.__init__()` is useful. We construct a shell block, meaning we set `mine=False` and construct the block using the attributes of the given block (including the given `nonce`). Then we just compare the `hash_val` of the shell block to the `hash_val` of the provided block. We also have to make sure the `hash_val` of the provided block is less than the `target`. But which `target`? Should we use `Block.target` or `Blockchain.target`. Well we're verifying the provided block, so we can't trust it. It's probably better to use `Blockchain.target`. Do the comparison by following the demonstration I made above (cast to `int` with base $16$). Finally, notice the provided block has a list of transactions in it. Verify all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`add_block()` adds a block to the `chain` list. You will want to verify the block before appending it to `chain`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`verify_chain()` verifies a whole chain of blocks. I'll discuss why that's useful in just a bit, but the process is easy. A chain of blocks is a list (array) of `Block` objects. Use `verify_block()` on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`find_block_idx()` takes in the hash of a block as an argument. It then searches `chain` and finds a block with a matching hash value (if it exists). It returns the index of that block. Therefore `chain[ block_index ]` returns a `Block` object with a `hash_val` matching the hash provided as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "`add_subchain()` is the reason `verify_chain()` and `find_block_idx()` are useful. It takes in a list (array) of `Block` objects. This list represents a subchain. We want to attach this subchain somewhere on the existing `chain`. The first block in the subchain has a `prev_hash` attribute (as all blocks do). That `prev_hash` points to a block somewhere in the existing `chain`. Find the index of this block. Create a new chain that consists of all blocks up to and including the block pointed to be `prev_hash`, followed by all the blocks in the subchain. This new chain needs to be verified. Do that using `verify_chain()`. Finally, it only makes sense to replace the existing `chain` with the new chain if the new chain is longer than the existing one. That's easy. Whichever one has more blocks wins. If they are equal in length, keep the existing chain and discard the new one.\n",

    "\n",
    "Upload the completed notebook to canvas. When you submit the assignment leave a comment. The comment should be the \"hash_val of block1 is:\" followed by the actual hash of block1. If you did everything right, you'll get an exact value. **You must submit this hash to get full points**. If you include a hash, but its wrong, you will get partial points. I will look through the code you wrote in the submitted notebook and give points for good effort. If you submit the completed notebook and the correct hash value, you are gauranteed full points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not submit a separate python file**. You must submit this notebook, completed, and nothing else (apart from the comment). Do not import any libraries that have not already been imported in the first code cell of this notebook. If you want to modify any of the existing code that I have provided, make a copy and do it below here (or just use a separate notebook, but don't submit it). Don't modify what I've provided outside of the TODO sections (unless you are implementing the bonus below).\n",

    "#### Bonus (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice I haven't implemented any code that checks or modifies the account balance contained in the account registry. Implement this feature. When a transaction from Alice is sent to Bob with the amount of 10. It should decrease Alice's account by 10, and increase Bob's by 10. If Alice doesn't have 10, it should throw an error. When miners mine blocks, their balanace should go up by the reward amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you implement this, include an additional comment saying \"I have implemented the bonus\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the submitted hash for block 1 should remain the same. Implementing the account balanace feature should not change the hashes of blocks or transactions.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Note on final project\n",
    "\n",
    "After submitting, feel free to play around with this notebook. Break things, exploit the many security holes I've left. If you enjoy it, consider extending it for your final project. Modify the existing code or start from scratch (I won't be offended). If you decide to do that, it should be a bit more sophisticated than what's in this notebook. Some ideas:\n",
    "- Use threads to simulate a distributed network where multiple miners are competing\n",
    "- Do the above and simulate an attack, e.g. > 51% attack\n",
    "- Replace the proof of work mechanism with proof of stake (or some other system)\n",
    "- Modify the existing code to be pure UTXO\n",
    "- Implement a simple scripting mechanism similar to bitcoin\n",
    "- Whatever you want\n",
    "\n",
    "Most final projects will implement smart contracts on an Ethereum-like network. But I do like to see simulation-oriented projects, so if you have an interest, feel free."
